Tutorials
-------------------

Many of the :ref:`Workshops` will host tutorial materials.  In fact, most
of the links to presentations here are from training workshops.


A partial list of websites with introductory and tutorial pages on XAFS


  * `XAFS Tutorials`_ from Grant Bunker, Illinois Institute of Technology
  * `XAS Overview`_ from Iztok Arcon, University of Nova Gorica, Jozef Stefan Institute, Slovenia
  * `X-ray Spectroscopy mini Courses`_ from Jim Penner-Hahn, University of Michigan.
  * `XAS Education`_ from Bruce Ravel, National Institute of Standards and
    Technology.  See also: https://speakerdeck.com/bruceravel

XAFS Tutorials and Overviews hosted on xafs.org (PDF format except where noted)
Except where noted, these are PDF files containing sets of slides for an oral presentation

Matt Newville's Tutorials: The last two files are companions to the longer write-up, containing similar material in a form more suitable for a lecture. This material (write-up, and the corresponding slides) is a work in progress. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
The Fundamentals of XAFS: a ~40 page introduction to XAFS, aimed at the advanced undergraduate level.

Fundamentals of X-ray Absorption Fine Structure

Anatomy of an XAFS Experiment

Shelly Kelly's Tutorials:
The Basics of processing chi(k) data in Athena: introducing the basics of processing chi(k) data in Athena.

The Basics of modeling EXAFS spectra in Artemis: introducing the basics of modeling EXAFS spectra in Artemis.

XAFS Tutorials and Overviews in languages other than English
