Databases for X-ray Absorption and XAFS measurements
----------------------------------------------------

For X-ray properties of the elements, including absorption cross-sections,
tools for calculating absorption lengths, mirror reflectivities,
monochromator Darwin widths and more, see

`X-ray Data for the Elements <https://xraydb.xrayabsorption.org>`_

Other databases of X-ray absorption and scattering properties of the
elements are at

Periodic Table of X-ray Absorption and Emission Energies
--------------------------------------------------------

Poster-sized Periodic Table of X-ray Absorption Edge energies and X-ray
emission line energies are available at
https://xrayabsorption.org/xraytable.  These display the energies of the
hard X-ray absorption edges (K, L1, L2, L3, M5) and the main K, L, and M
emission lines, as well as the electronic configuration and most common
oxidation states for each element.

The table is generated using X-ray data from W. T. Elam, B. D. Ravel
and J. R. Sieber, Radiation Physics and Chemistry **63** (2),
pp. 121–128 (2002) (`DOI:10.1016/S0969-806X(01)00227-4
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-806X(01)00227-4>`__). The code used
to generate this Poster is freely available as part of the `XrayDB
<https://github.com/xraypy/XrayDB/>`__ python module and database.





Crystallography
---------------

* `Crystallography Open Database
  <https://www.crystallography.net/cod/>`_ : CIF files of inorganic
  and small organic crystals in the public domain

..
  Atoms.inp Archive, a database of crystallographic data, ready to be converted to input files for FEFF, hosted at CARS
  The Ifeffit FAQ has a list of additional crystallography resources.

Reference data
--------------

* `XAFS Data Library <https://xaslib.xrayabsorption.org>`_, based on code
  at `XASDataLibrary <https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XASDataLibrary>`_ : A framework
  for a simple flask and SQLite based data library.

* `NIMS Material Data Repository <https://mdr.nims.go.jp>`_ contains a very
  large collection of XAFS spectra.

* `The Farrel Lytle Database at IIT
  <http://ixs.iit.edu/database/data/Farrel_Lytle_data/>`_.  Note:
  This is a
  "database" in the loosest possible sense of the term.

  .. todo:: Converting Lytle data to a usable form is a non-trivial
     problem.  Perhaps point to some examples of how to do so.
