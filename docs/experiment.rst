Experiments
===========

This page contains information related to experiments and measurements of XAFS and related Techniques

Synchrotrons, Light Sources, Beamlines
--------------------------------------

* `Lightsources.org is a collaboration between communicators from
  light source facilities around the world
  <https://lightsources.org>`_

.. * `IUCr XAFS Commission

.. <https://www.iucr.org/resources/commissions/xafs>`_ includingFederico BoscherinI's (University of Bologna) XAFS beamline compendium:

  * `Beamlines in the Americas <https://www.iucr.org/resources/commissions/xafs/beamlines-in-the-americas>`_
  * `Beamlines in Europe <https://www.iucr.org/resources/commissions/xafs/beamlines-in-europe>`_
  * `Beamlines in Asia and Oceania <https://www.iucr.org/resources/commissions/xafs/beamlines-in-asia-and-oceania>`_

.. sadly, this has long been held hostage by a recalcitrant IT
   department at BNL, even though it does not belong to BNL

  XAS data, and how to avoid them <Experiment/OverAbsorption.html>`_

Other topics
------------

* What information should be reported in your manuscirpt with XAFS
  Analysis (originally pointed to Reporting_EXAFS_Analysis)

* `Local structure refinement on the basis of XANES fitting using
  FitIt software
  <http://www.screencast.com/users/FitIt/folders/Screencasts>`_. Note:
  The videos on this site require Flash, so proceed with caution.
  Also, the videos focus on using `FitIt
  <http://nano.sfedu.ru/research/projects/fitit/>`_ and don't seem to
  provide much guidance on how to use either `Feff8
  <http://monalisa.phys.washington.edu/>`_ or `FDMNES
  <http://neel.cnrs.fr/spip.php?rubrique1007&lang=en>`_, the theory
  programs upon which it relies.
