Acronyms and Terms for X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
--------------------------------------------------------

There is a range of acronyms and terms surrounding X-ray absorption
spectroscopy and found in the literature.  Here we hope to define and
describe the most common acronyms and terms.  Several of these have
overlapping definitions and so usage varies.

Acronyms (and typical English pronunciations)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   * XAS **X-ray absorption spectroscopy**  ("Ex-A-Es") The entire field
     and spectral range of an X-ray absorption spectra.

   * XAFS **X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy**  ("Ex-afs" or
     "ZAFS")  The entire field and spectral range of an X-ray absorption
     spectra.

   * EXAFS **Extended X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy**
     ("Ex-afs")  The spectral range well beyond (say, +30 eV) the
     absorption threshold. Especially the part of the spectra for which a
     simple picture of photo-electron scattering in which single- (or a
     small-number of multiple-) scatterings can be used to interpret the
     spectra.

   * XANES **X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy** ("Zanes", sometimes
     "Ex anes") The spectral range at and nears (say, +/- 50 eV) the
     absorption threshold.  This is especially sensitive to formal
     oxidation state and coordination chemistry.  Used mostly to describe
     spectra with absorption edges energies > 2000 eV ("hard X-rays").


   * NEXAFS **Near-Edge X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy**
     ("Nex afs") The spectral range at and nears (say, +/- 50 eV) the
     absorption threshold.  This is especially sensitive to formal
     oxidation state and coordination chemistry.  Used mostly to describe
     spectra with absorption edges energies < 2000 eV ("soft X-rays").
