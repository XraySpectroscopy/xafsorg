About this site
-------------------


XAFS.ORG is a community site for x-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) and
related spectroscopies. It is part of the web pages sponsored by the
International XAFS Society,  https://xrayabsorption.org/.

XAFS.org started life as a Wiki hosted at https://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/xafs/.

The pages here are mostly a curated translation of those pages to the
Restructured Text format used by `Sphinx`_ documentation system, and held
in the Github reppository at `XAFS.ORG on Github`_


To the extent possible, the files here are place in the public domain
unless otherwise noted.  Most of the content on this site was written by
Matthew Newville and Bruce Ravel.  If you are interested in contributing or
adding new information, please use the Github page above or contact the
