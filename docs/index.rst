xafs.xrayabsorption.org (also xafs.org) is a community site for x-ray
absorption fine-structure (XAFS) and related spectroscopies. It is part of
the web pages sponsored by the International XAFS Society,

XAFS, EXAFS, and XANES
-----------------------

XAFS is a spectroscopic technique that uses the absorption of X-rays to
probe the physical and chemical structure of matter at an atomic
scale. X-ray absorption spectroscopy is element-specific, in that X-rays
are chosen to be at and above the binding energy of a particular core
electronic level of a particular atomic species. Because all but the
lightest elements have core-level binding energies in the X-ray regime,
nearly all elements can be studied with XAFS. Traditionally, the emphasis
has been on the heavier elements (of Z>15 or so), but applications to
lighter elements are also possible.

An energy-tunable X-ray source is needed to measure XAFS.  This typically
means that a synchrotron source is used, but some laboratory-based systems
do exist.

See :ref:`Acronyms` are a list and brief discussion of the many variations
on the terms and acronymy used to describe X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

More information about XAFS can related methods can be found on the pages.
