XAFS.ORG is a community site for x-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) and
related spectroscopies. It is part of the web pages sponsored by the
International XAFS Society,  https://xrayabsorption.org/.

XAFS, EXAFS, and XANES
-----------------------

XAFS is a spectroscopic technique that uses X-rays to probe the physical
and chemical structure of matter at an atomic scale. XAFS is
element-specific, in that X-rays are chosen to be at and above the binding
energy of a particular core electronic level of a particular atomic
species. Because all but the lightest elements have core-level binding
energies in the X-ray regime, nearly all elements can be studied with
XAFS. The emphasis has traditionally been on the heavier elements (of Z>15
or so).

An energy-tunable X-ray source is needed to measure XAFS, which typically
means a synchrotron is used. Unlike diffraction-based techniques for
studying atomic structure of matter, XAFS does not require a crystalline
samples.

More information about XAFS can related methods can be found on the pages.
