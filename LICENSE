On the other hand, many of the files here, such as slides from
presentations, are clearly labelled as being written by an author.  They
are posted here for educational purposes so that you are free to use them,
but you cannot claim that you wrote them.  If you use large sections of any
of those works, you should cite the authors work.  If you want to reuse
some of these materials, you should ask for permission for reuse.  Since
the materials here are for educational purposes, the authors will almost
certainly agree.
